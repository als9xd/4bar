# Working with the Production Server

### Access the Production Server

- Windows
    1. Download putty from here https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html and install
    2. Open putty and connect using 4bar.org as the hostname

- osx/linux
    1. Open a terminal and type ```ssh username@4bar.org``` replacing 'username' with the appropriate account

Note: The username and password were shared in the discord channel

### Stop the Production Webserver

1. Get the process id by typing ```ps aux | grep node ``` which should return something like: ```root 6844 0.0 0.0 49260 3484 pts/0 T 19:15 0:00 sudo node index.js --password p```. The process Id in this case is 6844
2. type ```sudo kill 6844``

### Start the Production Webserver

1. [Make Sure the Webserver isn't already running](#stop-the-production-webserver)
2. cd to '4bar/'
3. type ```sudo node index.js --password p &``` where p is the password for the postgresqsl database

# Working with the Repository

### Setup Git
1. Download git here https://git-scm.com/downloads and install

### Download the Repository

- First time download
    1. type ```git clone https://github.com/als9xd/4BAR``` from within the directory that you want it downloaded to

- Download and overwrite local files
    1. cd '4bar\'
    2. type ```git fetch```
    3. type ```git reset --hard origin/master```

Note: this won't remove untracked files or folders

- Download and Attempt to Merge with local files
    1. cd '4bar\'
    2. type ```git pull```

#### Upload Code to the Repository

Its probably best to create a new branch for your project and then do a pull request. Here are a couple of links that I used to understand this functionality.

[How a github workflow should look](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
[How brances work](https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell)

Note: before you push your code make sure you aren't pushing any icons/wallpapers

### Directory Structure

- 4bar/html 
    * contains all front end non-handlebars files

- 4bar/views 
    * contains all front end handlebars template files

- 4bar/helpers
    * contains all back end custom (but generalized) functions

- 4bar/connectors
    * contains all back end custom functions for interacting with specialized objects

- 4bar/community_data
    * contains all front end media (is available without authentication) 

- 4bar/config.js
    * contains all configuration settings for the webserver

- 4bar/index.js
    * main webserver application

# Postgresql Database

### Setup the Postgresql Database
- GUI
    1. Download postgresql from here https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads
    2. Run the installer. When prompted for password use 'pass' otherwise spam next.
    3. Open pgAdmin4
    4. Create a database named '4bar' with 'postgres' as the owner 

- Headless
    * osx/linux
        1. Install postresql through whatever method is supplied for your os
        2. To open the postgresql prompt type ```sudo -u postgres psql```
        3. To change the 'postgres' user's password type ```\password postgres```. Then enter 'pass' as the password.
        4. To create the database type ```CREATE DATABASE "4bar"```
        5. To change the database owner type ```ALTER DATABASE "4bar" OWNER TO postgres```
        6. To exit the psql promp type ```\q```

Note: These are just default settings. They be changed within 'config.js'

Issues: Right now connections aren't closed when node exits. This means in order to delete the database you must first
restart/stop the postgresql service.

# Node.js Webserver

### Setup the Node.js Webserver
1. Install node.js (8.9.4 LTS) from here https://nodejs.org/en/
    * If using windows you may have to start a new cmd prompt as administrator
3. Change directory to 4bar\
4. To install the webserver dependencies type ```npm install```

### Start the Node.js Webserver

- Windows
    1. cd to '4bar/'
    2. type ```node index.js``` within an admin command prompt

- OSX/Linux
   1. cd to '4bar/'
   2. type ```sudo node index.js```

The webserver should then be available at https://localhost

### Change the Node.js Webserver's Operating Environment

The two currently available environments are:

 1. development (default)
    - Use unsigned ssl certificate within '4bar/ssl/dev' directory
    - Saved postgresql credentials
 2. production
    - Use signed ssl certifcate within '4bar/../ssl' directory
    - Enter postgresql credentials on startup

Change them using the following: 

- Windows
    1. type ```SETX NODE_ENV=production```
- Debian
    1. type  ```export "NODE_ENV=production" >> ~/profile```
    2. relogin/restart shell to appply


# FAQ
- When I try to login or register 4bar gets stuck loading.
	* You may be having an issue connecting to the database. There should have been an error message that says what settings were used to attempt the connection 

- When I try to start the webserver I get this error ```Error: listen EACCES 0.0.0.0:80```
    * Make sure you are run with administrative priveleges (sudo on osx/linux, admin prompt on windows)
